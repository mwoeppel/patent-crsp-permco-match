# patent-crsp-permco-match
These data provide a patent-CRSP permco match, as in our published paper, Stoffman, N., Woeppel, M., and Yavuz, M.D. 2022. Small Innovators: No Risk, No Return. Journal of Accounting and Economics. The data in our paper span 1976 through 2019. The below data span 1976 through 2023.

| -------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| patnum   | Patent number                             |
| fdate    | Filing date of patent (mm/dd/yyyy)        |
| idate    | Issue (grant) date of patent (mm/dd/yyyy) |

These data span 1976 through 2023 and include only patents that we have matched the assignee to a firm in CRSP.  These data also include non-utility patents that we did not use in our paper (design patents, reissue patents, etc). In addition to string-matching algorithms, our extensive hand matching procedure helps resolves issues associated with mergers, acquisitions, asset sales, spin-offs, joint ventures, and other sources of inconsistency. For example, we match many patents assigned to two-party joint ventures to both owners of 50/50 joint venture. We plan to update these data at least annually.*

Non-utility patents
Of the 614,287 non-utility patents with an assignee between 1976 and 2023, we match 143,296, or 23.3%, to CRSP firms. Our non-utility patent database includes 3,112 unique permcos matched to patents.

Utility patents
Of the 7,128,825 utility patents with an assignee between 1976 and 2023, we match 2,904,230, or 40.7%, to CRSP firms. Our patent database includes 8,885 unique permcos matched to utility patents. As of February 2024, KPSS** match 2,544,432 patents, or 36.9%, to CRSP firms between 1976 and 2022. KPSS database includes 7,614 unique permcos.
