# patent-crsp-permco-match
These data provide a patent-CRSP permco match, as in our published paper, Stoffman, N., Woeppel, M., and Yavuz, M.D. 2022. Small Innovators: No Risk, No Return. Journal of Accounting and Economics. The data in our paper span 1976 through 2019. The below data span 1976 through 2024.

| -------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| patnum   | Patent number                             |
| fdate    | Filing date of patent (mm/dd/yyyy)        |
| idate    | Issue (grant) date of patent (mm/dd/yyyy) |
| permco   | CRSP permco                               |

These data span 1976 through 2024 and include only patents that we have matched the assignee to a firm in CRSP.  These data also include non-utility patents that we did not use in our paper (design patents, reissue patents, etc). In addition to string-matching algorithms, our extensive hand matching procedure helps resolves issues associated with mergers, acquisitions, asset sales, spin-offs, joint ventures, and other sources of inconsistency. For example, we match many patents assigned to two-party joint ventures to both owners of 50/50 joint venture. We plan to update these data at least annually.*

Of the 812,766 non-utility patents with an assignee between 1976 and 2024, we match 149,053, or 18.3%, to CRSP firms. Our non-utility patent database includes 3,153 unique permcos matched to patents.

Of the 8,206,179 utility patents with an assignee between 1976 and 2024, we match 3,003,008, or 36.6%, to CRSP firms. Our patent database includes 9,003 unique permcos matched to utility patents. As of March 2025, KPSS** match 2,708,442 patents, or 34.4%, to CRSP firms between 1976 and 2023. KPSS database includes 8,998 unique permcos.
